Put the headers that is going to be used with your source code at the same directory and simply include and use the functions. 
```C++
#include "PrimMst"
```
or
```C++
#include <PrimMst>
```
By copying the header files into the glibc include directory (ex. /usr/include/c++/VERSIONS/) which might be only for linux glibc, but please bear in mind that this project does not guarantee that the functions will be completely fine with other standard libraries.

Demos
----
You can try the demo source files as an example of how to use the implemented algorithms after correctly adding those headers. Simply just compile the demo source with g++ and run would be the whole process. We have designed to do so since the simplicity is very important on understanding and comfortably get used on.
