C++ Modulized Algorithms 
----
Trying to develop modulized algorithms in addition to the standard library, i.e. \<algorithm\>. The implementation would use template in C++ for ease of use the modulized works and further development.

All the implemented algorithms are in [algorithm\_headers](https://github.com/yhlim1225/OSS_G6/tree/master/algorithm_headers/) and test source codes are in [demo\_source](https://github.com/yhlim1225/OSS_G6/tree/master/demo_source/)

Please visit out [github\ repository](https://github.com/yhlim1225/OSS_G6)!
